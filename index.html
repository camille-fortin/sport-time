			<h2>What is Japanese Martial Arts?</h2>

			<p> A martial art is a style or school primarily taught in combat techniques, with bare hands or with a weapon. Historically, this learning incorporates a spiritual and moral dimension aimed at self-control and is enriched by multiple knowledge. Thus, martial arts aim at the overall development of the individual: external (strength, flexibility), internal (energy, health), intellectual and moral.</p>
